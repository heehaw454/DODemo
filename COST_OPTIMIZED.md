# Cost Optimization Overview for Flask SaaS App Deployment

This document describes how the Kubernetes deployment for the Flask SaaS app is cost optimized on DigitalOcean.

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Basic Droplets**
- The cluster uses basic (smallest recommended) Droplets for worker nodes, minimizing compute costs.
- No additional storage volumes or block storage are attached, reducing storage expenses.

### 2. **Node Count and Autoscaling**
- The default node count is set to **three**, providing high availability while keeping costs low.
- **Cluster autoscaling** is enabled:
  - Nodes automatically scale up to a maximum of **five** only when average CPU usage exceeds **70%**.
  - This ensures you only pay for extra resources when truly needed, avoiding over-provisioning.

### 3. **Resource Requests and Limits**
- Pod resource requests and limits are set appropriately to prevent unnecessary resource allocation.
- This helps the scheduler pack pods efficiently, reducing wasted capacity.

### 4. **Load Balancer Usage**
- Only one LoadBalancer service is provisioned, minimizing cloud networking costs.

### 5. **Stateless Application**
- The Flask app is stateless, so no persistent storage is required.
- This allows for easy scaling and avoids costs associated with stateful sets or database hosting.

### 6. **Monitoring and Alerts**
- Resource usage is monitored, and alerts are set for abnormal spikes.
- This enables proactive scaling and cost management.

### 7. **Image Optimization**
- The Docker image uses a slim Python base, reducing image size and speeding up deployments, which can lower bandwidth and storage costs.

### 8. **Idle Resource Management**
- Unused resources (nodes, services) are regularly reviewed and decommissioned to avoid unnecessary charges.

## Summary

This deployment is designed to balance reliability and cost:
- **Three nodes by default** for redundancy.
- **Autoscaling up to five nodes** only when needed.
- **No extra storage or unnecessary services**.
- **Efficient resource allocation** and monitoring.

These practices help ensure the Flask SaaS app runs reliably while keeping cloud costs predictable
